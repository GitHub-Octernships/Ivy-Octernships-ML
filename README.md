### About Us - Unified AI

Ivy is both an ML transpiler and a framework, currently supporting JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Numpy.

Ivy unifies all ML frameworks :boom: enabling you not only to write code that can be used with any of these frameworks as the backend, but also to convert :arrows_counterclockwise: any function, model or library written in any of them to your preferred framework!

You can check out [Ivy as a transpiler](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#ivy-as-a-transpiler) and [Ivy as a framework](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#ivy-as-a-framework) to learn more about this, try out Ivy straight away going through the [Setting up Ivy](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#setting-up-ivy) section, or dive deep into Ivy's [Documentation](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#documentation) and [Examples](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#examples)!

If you would like to contribute, you can join our growing [Community](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#community) :earth_africa:, check out our Contributing guide, and take a look at the open tasks if you'd like to dive straight in :technologist:

Let's [unify.ai](https://unify.ai/) together :mechanical_arm:

# Assignment

## Contribute to our [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle) Frontend Functions!

### Task instructions 📝

In this task, you will contribute one PaddlePaddle [Front-end function](https://unify.ai/docs/ivy/overview/deep_dive/ivy_frontends.html) that will become a part of the Ivy master branch. This would involve the following steps
- Choose one function from the list of [**open function tasks**](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/issues/19178)
- [Set up your environment](https://unify.ai/docs/ivy/overview/contributing/setting_up.html) to start working with Ivy
- Implement the function using the Ivy framework
- Implement the corresponding test for the function (to know where to place each of those files, refer to [our documentation](https://unify.ai/docs/ivy/)!)
- Commit and make a PR to the Main branch for this addition!

Upon approval and subsequent acceptance, your contribution will be attributed to you and added to the Ivy master branch.

Feel free to ask questions on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/sXyFF8tDtm)!
